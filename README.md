# BirdAudioClassifier

## Introduction
Without being a biologist, identifying the exact species of birds chirping, insects buzzing, and frogs croaking in the middle of a rainforest is almost an impossible task. These ecosystems are extremely biodiverse, with hundreds of different species coexisting, many of which sound very similar to the human ear.

Traditionally, biologists and field researchers have to rely on manual audio analysis and expert knowledge to identify species, which can be time-consuming and impractical. This inspires the BirdCLEF competition, which itself arises from the need to automate the monitoring of endangered wildlife of a Colombian Natural Reserve (El Silencio).

The project is on classification of under-studied and endangered animal species based on audio datafiles. The goal is to be able to develop a network capable of working with the audio datafiles effectively and identifying these species using only passive recordings. This will aid the efforts of researchers and conservation practitioners to better understand the ecological effects of the restoration. Doing so will ultimately enable them to adjust their actions to best protect the endangered animals within the reserve.
