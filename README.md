# BirdAudioClassifier

Traditionally, biologists and field researchers had to rely on manual audio analysis and expert knowledge to identify species, which can be time-consuming and not very practical. This inspired us to create a neural network to help identify birds based on the sounds they make. We decided to feed it labeled audio recordings of different bird calls and train the model to recognize bird species native to the Middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia. Our goal was to build a network that could accurately identify the bird species present in a short audio clip.
